\section{The size command}

\subsection{How it works}
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{size}}: computes the size of files inside a given directory. It takes as arguments  the directory path , a flag to indicate the desired size unit, an optional  -r flag to recursively calculate the size of files inside that directory and a -stat flag that gives some statistics about the file system.  \\

We first start by calling the function \textit{find\_dir\_from\_path} to check if the path is correct, if not it returns -1. If the path exists indeed, it returns the directory index in the directory file.\\

Next we use the function \textit{size\_dir\_files} that calculates the size of files inside a single directory with a simple for loop over the file array.\\

For the recursive part, we use the function \textit{size\_accumulator} that takes as an argument the index of a given directory and computes recursively the size of files inside of it. The base condition of this recursive function is to stop at a directory that doesn't have any children directories. We find the indices of the children directories of a given directory by calling the function \textit{get\_dir\_children} that uses another simple for loop over the directory array.\\

\lstset{language=bash,caption={Size command},label=code:size-command}
\begin{lstlisting}
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS write /tmp/foo.txt /dir1/foo1.txt
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS write /tmp/4mb /dir2/4mb1
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS size /dir1 -b -r
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS size /dir2 -k -r
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS size / -b -stat
\end{lstlisting}
