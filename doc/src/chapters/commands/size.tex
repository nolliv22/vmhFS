\section{The size command}

\subsection{How it works}
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{size}}: computes the size of files inside a given directory. If the -r flag is indicated, size should recursively calculate the size of files inside that directory. \\

This function takes as an argument the directory path. We use the function \textit{find\_dir\_from\_path} to check if the path is correct, if not it returns -1. If the path exists indeed, it returns the directory index in the directory file.\\

We also use the function \textit{size\_dir\_files} that calculates the size of files inside a single directory with a simple for loop over the file array.\\

For the recursive part, we use the function \textit{size\_accumulator} that takes in argument an index of a given directory. The base condition of this recursive function is to stop at a directory that doesn't have any children directories. We compute the indices of a given directory by using the function \textit{get\_dir\_children} that uses another simple for loop over the directory array. Its algorithm is very similar to the one used in the recursive ls.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS write /tmp/foo.txt /dir1/foo1.txt
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS write /tmp/4mb /dir2/4mb1

$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS size /dir2 -k -r
$ vmhFS /tmp/tmpFS size / -b -stat
